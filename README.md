# scrambled-word-guessing-game-in-cpp

Simple game where the user tries to guess a word after seeing it with one letter removed.
3 fails = game over; after 3 successful guesses the word appears with the order scrambled in addition to having one letter removed.

Developed entirely on my iPhone using CodeSnack IDE, I'm publishing it in case anyone might wanna read and learn from it
